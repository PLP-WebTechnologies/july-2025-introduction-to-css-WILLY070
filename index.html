    <h1>Humans and their effect on climate</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">Humans have significantly influenced the Earth's climate through activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial production, and large-scale agriculture.<br>
         These actions release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing global temperatures to rise — a phenomenon known as global warming.<br>
          As a result, the planet is experiencing more extreme weather events, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems.<br>
           While technological advancements and economic growth have improved living standards, they have also come at the cost of environmental stability.<br>
            To mitigate these effects, humanity must transition to renewable energy sources, protect forests, and adopt sustainable practices that balance
             human needs with the planet’s long-term health.</p>
     <br>

    <p class="paragraph">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by improving efficiency, reducing waste, and enabling smarter decision-making.<br>
         In areas like energy management, AI helps optimize renewable energy use and monitor environmental changes in real time.<br>
          However, AI development and operation also have environmental costs.<br>
           Training large AI models requires massive amounts of electricity, often generated from non-renewable sources, which contributes to carbon emissions.<br>
            Additionally, the production of hardware for AI systems demands significant raw materials and resources.<br>
             The challenge is to develop AI in ways that minimize its ecological footprint while maximizing its potential to address climate issues, such as predicting natural disasters, improving sustainable farming, and advancing clean energy technologies.</p>
